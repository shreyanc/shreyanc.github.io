## Upshot
 - Capturing **long-term cyclic temporal structure** in audio data collected from an urban acoustic sensor network.
 - Downstream task -- urban sound tagging.

## Pointers
 - Successful pretext tasks are those that require some understanding of the concepts of interest in the downstream task.
 - Common pretext tasks: sequential structure, spatial structure, short-term temporal structure, multi-modal structure.
 - This method is suited for single-modal supervision (e.g **machine condition monitoring**) that does not have clear visual correlates.
 - This approach may not be limited to audio.
