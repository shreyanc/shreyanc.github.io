## Upshot
- Pre-training using stacked double network - one **encoder** network and one **context** network.

## Pointers
- Choosing normalization scheme is important. They normalize both across the feature and temporal dimension for each sample. The layers in both the encoder and context networks consist of causal convolution with 512 channels, a group normalization layter and a ReLU nonlinearity.

## Details
- For decoding the emissions from the acoustic model, they use a lexicon and a separate language model. The word sequence $\mathbf{y}$ is decoded from the context vector $\mathbf{c}$ using the **beam search decoder**. 
- Objective: We train the model to distinguish a sample $z_{i+k}$ that is k steps in the future from distractor samples $\tilde z$ drawn from a proposal distribution $p_n$, by minimizing the contrastive loss for each step $k = 1, ... ,K:$
