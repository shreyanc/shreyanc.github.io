title: Learning Semantic Similarity in Music via Self-Supervision
---
## Upshot
- The authors propose two related methods for learning symbolic music embeddings such that semantically similar inputs lie closer together in the latent space than dissimilar ones.
- This is achieved by defining **adjacent sections of a musical input to be semantically similar** and constraining the embeddings to come from a **Gaussian prior distribution**.
