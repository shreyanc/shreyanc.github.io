Hello world! 
I am a PhD student at the [Institute of Computational Perception](https://www.jku.at/en/institute-of-computational-perception/), at Johannes Kepler University Linz, Austria. Currently I am working on the [Con Espressione](https://www.jku.at/en/institute-of-computational-perception/research/projects/con-espressione/) project ("Towards Expressivity-aware Computer Systems in Music") under the guidance of [Prof. Gerhard Widmer](https://www.jku.at/en/institute-of-computational-perception/about-us/people/gerhard-widmer/), where we are using deep learning to understand what makes musical performances expressive and emotionally moving.

My research interests lie in audio processing, intelligent music processing, music information retrieval, computer vision, and multi-modal information fusion.
